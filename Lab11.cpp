// A prime number is an integer number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than one and itself.
// Write a program that will prompt the user for an integer n that will be tested to determine if it is a prime number. 
// The best approach is to start by assuming the integer n is a prime number (isPrime=true) and attempting to prove 
// it is not prime by testing it to find a number i that divides it evenly using the modulo (remainder) operator (i.e.  n%i==0 ).
